<p># BinaryPowWeb</p>

<p>BinaryPow is a simple binary game that guesses a number after the user confirms a set of six card containing numbers from 1 to 73. 
I found about this game while reading a phisical <a href="https://www.oceano.com/oceano/catalogo/buscador.asp?IdThemeGN=21&IdThemeLB=21&TypSearch=1&IdBook=38&DbName=GN">enciclopedy </a>when I was younger, then I wanted to play it on my phone.</p>

<p>I first developed BinaryPow for Android on december 2017. By that time I was using Xamarin Framework + C#.</p>

<p>This repository contains the web version of the game</p>

<p>There are still so many bugs to fix. Most of them related to the mobile view. Be patinent, I'm waiting for a miracle to have time ti fix them!</p>

<p>Feel free to use the code, refactor and share it.</p>
